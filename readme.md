# Computer Vision - Object Detection
**Authors**: Nicklas Vraa, Mathias Vraa

This repository hosts our project for the 'Computer Vision' course at Aarhus University. We will be implementing an object detector using a transformer architecture.

## Repository Overview
Notebooks:
- To see how we prepared and preprocessed our data, please see the notebook: \
  [1_preprocessing.ipynb](notebooks/1_preprocessing.ipynb)

- To see how we developed our variational autoencoder, please see the notebook: \
  [2_training.ipynb](notebooks/2_training.ipynb)

- To see how we developed our segmentation decoder, please see the notebook: \
  [3_testing.ipynb](notebooks/3_testing.ipynb)

- The model architectures are defined in a separate python file for convenience: \
  [models.py](notebooks/models.py)

- Additional utility functions and constants are also defined in a separate file: \
  [utility.py](notebooks/utility.py)

Thank you for your attention.
